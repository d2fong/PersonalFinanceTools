# PersonalFinanceTools

## What is this?
  As the name of this project suggests, this will be an collection of independent tools used for managing personal finance.  

## Why make this?
  1.  The goal fo this project is to help people manage their personal finances.  Whether you are determining if it is better to rent or buy a house, or comparing investment options, PersonalFinanceTools aims to provide tools that make these decisions easier.
  2.  This is an intersection of two areas (programming and personal finance) that I am both interested in and currently looking to improve my skills in.  A natural response of mine is to create a project that fulfills these needs.
